# Changing product versions

Before publication, the version must be moderated by technical experts and editors. You can edit a version until it is submitted for moderation. After it passes moderation, you can also make changes. In that case, you will have to resubmit the version for moderation. When moderation succeeds, the publisher can publish the approved version.

To change the version:

1. Log in to the [{{ marketplace-short-name }} partner interface]({{ link-cloud-partners }}).

1. Open the **{{ ui-key.yacloud_portal.portal.products }}** section and select a product.

1. On the **{{ ui-key.yacloud_portal.marketplace_v2.product.tab_versions }}** tab, select the version.

1. In the top-right corner, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.edit }}**.

1. Make changes and click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.edit }}**.

While a version is under moderation, you can [add a new version](create-new-version.md) to the product.
