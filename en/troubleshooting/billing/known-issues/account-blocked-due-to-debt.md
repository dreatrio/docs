# Billing account is in the PAYMENT_REQUIRED status

## Issue description {#issue-description}

* The billing account is in the PAYMENT_REQUIRED status
* The use of cloud resources is blocked.

## Solution {#issue-resolution}

The use of Yandex Cloud services is suspended due to an outstanding amount in your billing account. To continue using the services, top up your balance.

By default, YandexÂ Cloud expects the outstanding amount for the past reporting period to be paid off no later than the 14th of the following month.

You can only have an outstanding amount within your payment threshold for one reporting month, even if you have not reached the threshold by the end of the month.  Each reporting period ends on the 30th or 31st of the calendar month.

You cannot cover an outstanding balance with a promo code or grant. Those only apply to the expenditures incurred after their activation.
