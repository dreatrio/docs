# Limitations in the {{ region-id }}-d availability zone

Some services run with limitations in the `{{ region-id }}-d` availability zone.

Our engineers are working on the issue. Information on the page will be updated as and when the limitations are removed.

## {{ data-transfer-full-name }} {#data-transfer}

Full-fledged operation of {{ data-transfer-name }} within the `{{ region-id }}-d` availability zone is not yet supported.

For {{ data-transfer-name }} to run properly, make sure the data source or target is hosted outside `{{ region-id }}-d`.

## {{ managed-k8s-name }} {#managed-k8s}

So far, you cannot create clusters and nodes in the `{{ region-id }}-d` availability zone.
