# Getting a download link

If you have a public bucket, its objects are always available even if no [website hosting](../../concepts/hosting.md) is configured for the bucket. You can get a link by following these instructions or generate one yourself. [Read more about the link format](../../concepts/object.md#object-url).

If you have a bucket with restricted access, {{ objstorage-name }} allows you to generate a pre-signed URL to an object. Anyone who receives this link can download the object even from a bucket with restricted access. You can read more about pre-signed URLs, their generation, and their use [here](../../concepts/pre-signed-urls.md).

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  {% include [storage-get-link-for-download](../../_includes_service/storage-get-link-for-download.md) %}

{% endlist %}

{% note info %}

You cannot extend the validity period of a pre-signed URL to an object in a bucket with restricted access. If the URL has expired, generate a new one.
