# {{ serverless-containers-name }} pricing




## What goes into the cost of using {{ serverless-containers-name }} {#rules}

In {{ serverless-containers-name }}, you are billed for the number of container invocations, computing resources allocated for the application, downtime of [provisioned instances](concepts/container.md#provisioned-instances), and outgoing traffic.

Computing resources are billed based on the number of processor cores (vCPUs), the [level of core performance](../compute/concepts/performance-levels.md), memory allocated for the application, and application running time:
* The number of cores specified when creating a revision is measured in vCPUs and is a positive real number.
* The core performance level specified when creating a revision is measured in %.
* The memory size specified when creating a revision is measured in GB.
* The total container time is measured in hours and is rounded up to a multiple of 100 ms.

{% note warning %}

You are only charged for the container invocations that have caused your application to run.

{% endnote %}


### Pricing formula {#formula}

Monthly cost = {{ sku|USD|serverless.containers.compute.memory|pricingRate.10|string }} × Memory (GB) × Invocation processing time (Hours) + {{ sku|USD|serverless.containers.compute.cpu|pricingRate.5|string }} × vCPU count × Invocation processing time (Hours) + {{ sku|USD|serverless.containers.invocations|pricingRate.1|string }} × Millions of invocations

### Examples of cost calculation {#example}

Example of calculating the cost of a container with the following parameters:
* **Memory specified when creating a revision**: 2 GB
* **Number of cores**: 20% vCPU
* **Number of container invocations**: 3,000,000
* **Execution time of each call**: 150 ms

> 
> 0.0256 × (2 × (150 / 3,600,000) × 3,000,000 – 10) + 0.0384 × (0.2 × (150 / 3,600,000) × 3,000,000 – 5) + 0.1280 × ((3,000,000 – 1,000,000) / 1,000,000)
> 
>
> Total: $7.1680

Where:
* 0.0256 is the cost of 1 GB×hour in excess of 10 GB×hour per month.
* 2 is the amount of RAM.
* 150 / 3,600,000 converts milliseconds to hours, as RAM usage time is calculated in GB×hour.
* 3,000,000 is the number of container invocations.
* 10 is the free of charge RAM usage time.
* 0.0384 is the cost per hour of CPU usage in excess of 5 vCPU × hour per month.
* 0.2 is the number of vCPU cores.
* 150 / 3,600,000 converts milliseconds to hours, as CPU usage time is calculated in GB×hour.
* 3,000,000 is the number of container invocations.
* 5 is the free of charge CPU usage time.
* 0.1280 is the cost of 1 million container invocations in excess of 1 million per month.
* 3,000,000 is the number of container invocations.
* 1,000,000 is subtracted because the first million invocations are free of charge.
* 1,000,000 is the divisor used to calculate the number of millions of container invocations.
